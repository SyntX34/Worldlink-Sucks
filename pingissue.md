##### ***This has to be inside 15ms, basically Google has 26 servers all over the world, and when you ping it's domain, it checks your location and ping you to nearest server for better response, same logic goes for Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, and discord (discord has 4 servers in total).***







##### **While I watching Instagram reels, it only load those videos which is saved as cache, you may say to clear cache from phone, I formatted my phone today and re-tested it.**
